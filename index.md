### <a name="story"></a>The story

Cart Shed Research was started in 2020 by partners Katie Walker and Roland Whitehead. After the end of the UK's leading enterprise open source solutions business, Quru, Roland was looking for a vehicle to continue his more exploratory work and combined with long term collaborator Katie to pursue research and development work.

Roland originally trained as a naval architect and product designer and worked with some highly innovative yacht design practices and product design teams. He designed race and cruising yachts of various sizes and was a small part of the team that developed the original Novopen - the insulin injector that has since saved many lives. Over time, Roland's work became more and more digital although at one stage he lead a team originating more pages of print than the UK's biggest magazine publisher - having, of course, fully colour managed and digitised the whole process first.

Katie is a world reknowned furniture designer and sculptor. Her award winning work has always pushed both aesthetic and practical boundaries, often taking traditional forms and techniques and developing them in highly innovative ways. Her work can be found in private and public collections world-wide as well as in many homes.
